# BloomBox Landing Page

A high-converting, mobile-first landing page for BloomBox, an online flower shop specializing in fresh floral arrangements delivered daily.

## Project Overview

This project is a responsive landing page designed to showcase BloomBox's products and services. The design focuses on conversion optimization with clear calls-to-action, attractive product displays, and a clean, modern aesthetic inspired by nature.

### Key Features

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- **Modern UI**: Clean design with a soft, nature-inspired color palette
- **Interactive Elements**: Countdown timer for limited-time offers
- **Conversion-Focused**: Strategic placement of CTAs and value propositions
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast-loading single page implementation

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and countdown functionality
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library for visual elements

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: Contains all HTML structure, inline Tailwind CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality
- `README.md`: This documentation file

## Setup and Deployment

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the BloomBox landing page:

### 1. File Creation

The project includes two essential files:
- `index.html`: The complete landing page with all necessary code
- `README.md`: This documentation file

Both files should be in the root directory of your project.

### 2. Code Review

Before deployment, review the `index.html` file to ensure all elements are rendering correctly:
- Check that all sections are properly displayed
- Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes
- Test the JavaScript countdown timer functionality
- Confirm all links are properly configured (though they are placeholder links in this demo)

### 3. Git Initialization

Initialize a Git repository in your project folder:

```bash
git init
```

### 4. Set Remote Repository

Add your remote repository with the name "mcp":

```bash
git remote add mcp [URL_HERE]
```

Replace `[URL_HERE]` with your actual repository URL.

### 5. Commit and Push

Commit your files and push them to the remote repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial BloomBox landing page setup"
git push -u mcp main
```

## Local Development

To view the landing page locally:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
2. No build process or server is required as all dependencies are loaded via CDN

## Customization

The landing page can be easily customized:

- **Colors**: Modify the Tailwind config in the `<head>` section of `index.html`
- **Images**: Replace the placeholder image URLs with your actual product images
- **Content**: Update text content to match your specific offerings and brand voice
- **Contact Information**: Update the footer with your actual contact details and social media links
